# Child Mortality Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting child mortality rates based on various infant underlying causes and maternal factors. The goal is to identify the top contributing factors to child death and develop predictive models to aid in understanding and addressing this critical issue.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on child mortality cases, including features such as:
- Case type
- Underlying cause
- Main maternal disease

## Features
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy Score, ROC Curve, AUC Score
- **Visualization**: Feature Importance, Top Infant Underlying Causes, Top Maternal Factors, Child Death by Case Type

## Repository Structure
